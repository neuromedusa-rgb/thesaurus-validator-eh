## üéØ Features

- **Intelligent Auto-Classification**: Terms automatically categorized based on relevance score and occurrence frequency
- **Manual Validation Interface**: Review and override suggestions with confidence levels
- **Batch Processing**: Review 20 terms at a time with progress tracking
- **Real-time Statistics**: Monitor keep/merge/eliminate decisions
- **VOSviewer Integration**: Export validated thesaurus in VOSviewer-compatible CSV format
- **Protected Keywords**: Automatically identifies and protects important EH concepts
- **Decision Review**: Review and modify decisions before final export

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thesaurus-validator-eh.git

# Navigate to directory
cd thesaurus-validator-eh

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## üìñ Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Export term frequency and relevance data from VOSviewer:
```
File ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Save term relevance scores
```

Expected format (`ha_fr_u10.txt`):
```
id    term              occurrences    relevance score
1     anthropocene      94             0.4521
2     climate change    72             0.3419
...
```

### Step 2: Upload and Classify

1. Click "Select File" and choose your frequency-relevance file
2. System automatically classifies terms into categories:
   - **CONCEPTUAL**: Theoretical/analytical terms (keep)
   - **EMPIRICAL**: Concrete entities (keep)
   - **META-TERM**: Methodological language (evaluate)
   - **EMPTY**: Generic/irrelevant (eliminate)
   - **REDUNDANT**: Overlapping meaning (merge)

### Step 3: Validate Terms

Review each term with:
- Occurrence count and relevance score
- Automatic classification and confidence level
- Suggested action (KEEP/MERGE/ELIMINATE)

Make your decision:
- ‚úÖ **Keep**: Maintain term in thesaurus
- üîÄ **Merge**: Combine with another term (enter target term)
- ‚ùå **Eliminate**: Remove from thesaurus

### Step 4: Export Validated Thesaurus

Click "Export Thesaurus" to download `tesauro_validado.csv`:

```csv
label,replace_by,action,justification
activity,,eliminate,META-TERM - occurrences: 31, relevance: 0.70
climate crisis,environmental crisis,merge,Merged with environmental crisis
anthropocene,,keep,CONCEPTUAL validated
```

Import this file into VOSviewer as a thesaurus file.

## üß™ Classification Criteria

| Category | Condition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| EMPTY | relevance < 0.3 AND occurrences < 20 | ELIMINATE |
| EMPTY | term in stopwords list | ELIMINATE |
| CONCEPTUAL | relevance > 1.5 | KEEP |
| CONCEPTUAL | occurrences > 50 | KEEP |
| META-TERM | term in methodology_terms | EVALUATE |
| SPECIFIC | term contains EH_keywords | KEEP |

### Protected Keywords

Terms automatically suggested for keeping:
```
anthropocene, sustainability, ecology, biodiversity, ecocriticism,
nonhuman, posthuman, multispecies, landscape, heritage, conservation,
climate change, environmental justice, resilience
```

## üî¨ Methodology

This tool implements the term selection methodology described in:

- **Van Eck, N.J., & Waltman, L. (2010).** Software survey: VOSviewer, a computer program for bibliometric mapping. *Scientometrics*, 84(2), 523-538.
- **Sinkovics, N. (2016).** Enhancing the foundations for theorising through bibliometric mapping. *International Marketing Review*, 33(3), 327-350.

The relevance score calculation follows VOSviewer's algorithm, which automatically identifies the most representative terms for a corpus.
